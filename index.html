        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm a recent graduate from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Graphics and Multimedia Software. I'm passionate about both playing and developing games, with a strong interest in creating interactive, meaningful, and visually engaging experiences.

During my time at university, I studied a wide range of game design conceptsâ€”from narrative structure and level design to UI/UX and player engagement theory. I've applied this knowledge through hands-on development of several game projects, both individually and as part of a team. These projects allowed me to explore 2D pixel art aesthetics, gameplay mechanics, and player experience from prototype to polish.

I'm deeply interested in the intersection of creativity and technology. Whether it's crafting gameplay systems, designing intuitive interfaces, or optimizing performance for smoother play, I strive to bring thoughtful design and technical precision together.</p>
